                    My love affair with written media started very early; growing up in the countryside does that to a person. As a kid, when there's no cable TV, you either play outside or read. I chose the latter. Starting with books and newspaper comics, I ended up reading papers from the front page to the last page, and tried my hand at writing for the school paper.

                    By the time I finished school I knew this is what I wanted to do for a living. I wrote for small publications while working on my bachelor, and got freelance gigs while doing my master's. The rest is history.
